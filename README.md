# WARNING THESE ARE UNAUDITED CONTRACTS

This is a deflationary ERC20 token. Every transaction burns 1% of the tokens. You can stake defi tokens to earn Spaghetti. There is no premine, dev allocation or any shennigans like that.

The staking contracts are taken from synthetix. The token is a modified ds-token from DappHub. 

To run the hevm test, download the code, install https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools and then run `./test.sh`. Side note: hevm is very cool and people should use this more.
